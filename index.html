            Hello and thanks for viewing!<br>
            My name is Brandon Leek and I'm a front-end web developer.

            <title id="section-titles">About Me</title>
            I have recently graduated from Thinkful's Software Engineering Immersion program.<br>
            I have implemented a variety of projects using HTML, CSS, Javascript and many of it's widely used libraries
            and frameworks.<br>
            Having been exposed to internet technologies at a young age, as well as being a former sales representative
            of mobile devices, my recent pursuit down this career path just feels natural.
            The ongoing revolution in how humanity interacts and creates is an infinite source of inspiration to me and
            I am devoted to being a part of it. Open-source projects are my favorite part of it all! The accessibility
            to all, as well as the sense of community and bonding between developers all over the globe that it fosters
            is a beautiful thing.
            When I'm not writing mark up and scripting, I am travelling the country to new cities and nature in
            immersive concerts and festivals with friends I have made from every corner of the country.

            <title id="section-titles">Multiple Choice Quiz App</title>
            My first web application is a simple 5 question quiz, made for anyone that enjoys simple bar trivia and
            wants to test their knowledge of worldly, yet relatively basic facts. This application keeps track of the
            users score, displays whether the user submitted a correct or incorrect answer after every question and
            allows the user to reset the quiz from the beginning upon completion. This application utilizes the widely
            deployed Javascript jQuery library, which is used in more than half of the top 1 million websites in the
            world! <p>You can take the quiz yourself <a href="https://thinkful-ei-macaw.github.io/quizapp_DB/"

            Please note that this was a collaborative effort with one of my peers.

            <title id="section-titles">Bookmarks App</title>
            My second web application is a Bookmarks application, that also utilizes jQuery and a public API that makes
            post, update, and delete requests. It also has an expand/collapse function to view details of individual
            bookmarks, validates user entry forms when adding a new bookmark, and a rating function from 1 to 5 that
            allows you to filter by your bookmarks rating. The API functionality allows the user to access them from any
            device, as
            any bookmarks app should!

            <title id="section-titles">Coronavirus in the USA - A Message Board</title>
             Furthering my skills to full-stack programming with more modern tools than jQuery, my third effort is an anonymous message board on the subject of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. Using React.js for client-side and Node.js for server-side, I created a small platform for users to discuss & share their experiences, hardships, triumphs, and whatever else they see relevant by the state or US territory they reside in during the pandemic. Users are prompted to provide a name or alias they choose, select 1 of 54 states/territories, and their most recent occupation. From there, they are directed to the state they can leave their thoughts, see what others commented, and view the current total cases and fatalities relative to that state.
