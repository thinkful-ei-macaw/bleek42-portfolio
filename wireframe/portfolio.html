            Hello and thanks for viewing!<br>
            My name is Brandon Leek and I'm a front-end web developer.

        <section id="about-me">
            I have recently graduated from Thinkful's Software Engineering Immsersion program.<br>
            I have implemented a variety of projects using HTML, CSS, Javascript and many of it's widely used libraries and frameworks.<br>
            Having been exposed to internet technologies at a young age, as well as being a former sales representative of mobile devices, my recent pursuit down this career path just feels natural. 
            The ongoing revolution in how humanity interacts and creates is an infinite source of inspiration to me and I am devoted to being a part of it. Open-source projects are my favorite part of it all! The accessibility to all, as well as the sense of community and bonding between developers all over the globe that it fosters is a beautiful thing. 
            When I'm not writing mark up and scripting, I am travelling the country to new cities and nature in immersive concerts and festivals with friends I have made from every corner of the country.

            My first web application is a quiz using the jQuery library, which you can
            find <a href="https://github.com/thinkful-ei-macaw/quizapp_DB">here</a>, on GitHub!<br>
            Please note that this was a collaborative effort with one of my peers.

            My second project was a solo effort, which also utilized jQuery and features ES6 modules.<br>
            I created a bookmarks organizer, that allows you to give the user a title, description, and a 1 - 5 rating for their bookmarks.<br>
            Please find and try it for yourself <a href="https://github.com/thinkful-ei-macaw/bleek-bookmarks-app">here!</a>
